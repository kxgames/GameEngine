Things to Improve
=================
1. The server will crash if it receives a packet it doesn't understand.  I 
   should add to the network module the ability to define a "bad packet 
   handler" that gets called whenever a packet is received that couldn't be 
   understood.  On the server, this handler would log an error and maybe fire a 
   message to the client explaining the problem.  On the client, this would 
   just log an error I guess.
